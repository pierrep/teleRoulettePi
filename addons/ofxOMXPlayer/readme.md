STATUS: PERPETUAL DEVELOPMENT   
CURRENT KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES:   
Videos with and audio track (even silent) work best and allow more accurate looping/frame tracking

DESCRIPTION:   
This is an openFrameworks video player addon for the Raspberry Pi. The video player is hardware accelerated and can provide textures to openFrameworks to be used for shaders, etc.

REQUIREMENTS:   
GPU split set to 128 (may need to be higher for larger videos)
openFrameworks version 0.8 or higher http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/

USAGE:   
(NEW) Clone into openFrameworks/addons

There 2 modes of Playback, textured or non-textured. 

Non-Textured:   
 - By default is played fullscreen video
 - OF is still able to run other processes in the background. 
 - 1080p video playback is typically good

Textured:   
Allows the use of
 - shaders
 - pixel access
 - drawing overlays
 - 720p video works best here

Audio:   
 - Audio can be played back through HDMI or headphone jack
 - May be disabled to save resources
 - initialVolume can be passed


Headphone jack may require this tweak:

To use HDMI Audio you may need to add the below line to /boot/config.txt and reboot. See http://elinux.org/RPiconfig for more details

hdmi_drive=2

EXAMPLES:   
example-basic:   
Playback of video in texture mode (default)

example-multiple-players:   
Simultaneous playback 2 videos in non-texture mode

example-playlist:   
Playback of a folder of videos in texture mode

example-pixels:   
Example of pixel access that is needed for OpenCv operations/Saving images, etc

example-restartMovie:   
restart a movie by pressing "r" + ENTER in ssh session (or "r" on attached keyboard)

example-shader:   
Use of shaders, fbos and video

example-multiple-players:   
EXPERIMENTAL: shows some of the more "alpha" features
 - Multiple players
 - Usage of a display area to play non-textured video non-fullscreen

COMPRESSION RECOMMENDATIONS:   
 - Use MPEGStreamclip (http://www.squared5.com/)
 - H.264
 - Quality 50%
 - PCM Audio (more compatible with HDMI)

TODO:   
 - Implement better Seeking
 - General cleanup (many properties are public)
 - Possibly have it extend ofBaseVideoPlayer
